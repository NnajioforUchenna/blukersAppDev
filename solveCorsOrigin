1. Create a JSON file with the CORS Configuration
First, create a file named cors.json and include the following content:

json
Copy code
[
  {
    "origin": ["*"],
    "method": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
    "maxAgeSeconds": 3600,
    "responseHeader": ["Content-Type", "Authorization"]
  }
]
The above configuration allows all origins (*) and specifies the allowed methods and headers.

2. Install the Google Cloud SDK
Make sure you have the Google Cloud SDK installed, as you'll be using the gsutil command-line tool to update the CORS settings.

3. Authenticate with Google Cloud
If you haven't already authenticated with Google Cloud, you can do so with:

bash
Copy code
gcloud auth login


4. Update CORS Configuration for Your Bucket
Run the following command to update the CORS configuration for your bucket. Replace YOUR-BUCKET-NAME with the name of your storage bucket:

bash
Copy code
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME


5. Verify the Configuration
You can verify that the CORS configuration has been applied by running:
bash
Copy code
gsutil cors get gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME
This will print the current CORS configuration for the bucket, allowing you to confirm that it matches what you've set.

Conclusion
With these steps, you should have configured CORS for your Google Cloud Storage bucket according to the provided rules. Make sure to replace YOUR-BUCKET-NAME with your actual bucket name in the above commands. If you want to restrict the origins further, replace "*" with the actual domains you want to allow.
